
1.Which countries have the highest average contaminant levels in their water sources?

2.What is the average pH level by region, ordered from most acidic to most alkaline?

3.How many distinct water treatment methods are recorded in the dataset?


4.Which water source types (lake, river, well, etc.) are associated with the highest bacteria counts on average?

5.How does access to clean water percentage relate to infant mortality rates across different countries?

6.How have cholera cases per 100,000 people changed over the years in each country?

7.Is there a trend in water treatment methods used over time (comparing earlier vs. more recent years)?

8.Compare the average nitrate levels between countries with high vs. low GDP per capita (define your own thresholds).

9.Which countries have both high turbidity (NTU) and high lead concentration in their water?

10.Create a ranking of countries by their overall water quality (consider multiple factors like contaminant level, pH, turbidity, etc.).

11.Identify regions where water treatment methods don't seem to be effectively reducing disease cases.

12.Are there any records with impossible or highly unlikely values (e.g., pH outside 0-14 range)?

13.How complete is the data for each country (percentage of null values per country)?

14.What would be the most insightful way to visualize the relationship between sanitation coverage and waterborne diseases?

15.How could you present the geographical distribution of water quality issues using this data?
